Personal Portfolio

This Webpage was made with the sole objective of recreating a virtual Portfolio with some CV attributes in order to show future employers and connections a bit of who I am, what I know and what I can offer.

Furthermore, the secondary purpose of this portfolio is to practice JS, HTML5 & CSS 3 and learn Bootstrap.

Some of the Webpage attributes were inspired by Drew Ryan.

The Javascript Animations were obtained from
